[PsySunrise's Music Station][station]
==========================

You may find some interesting and beautiful musics here, which I collected myself, and most of them are downloaded from the Internet. We're in China, so thanks to the government, no one wants to be in patent issues. If in doubt, please do not sue me. Just move on and go somewhere else to listen to them.


Importing New Musics
--------------------

Most of the times, you may not have the permissions required to write in this directory. If you have some interesting requests, plase contact [me][] or the administrator of [The original website][This website]. 

Setup instructions:

 - Put all of your musics planned to import in a directory tree 
   whose deepest folders should contain only mp3/ogg files 
   and will be automatically transformed as a list.
 - `scp` the directory tree in `./music/media`
 - run `make` in `./music`
 - Voilà! Go to [the station][station] and enjoy!
