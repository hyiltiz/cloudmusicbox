We're in China, so thanks to the government, no one wants to be in patent issues. If in doubt, please do not sue me. Just move on and go somewhere else to listen to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting New Musics\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nMost of the times, you may not have the permissions required to write in this directory. If you have some interesting requests, plase contact [me][] or the administrator of [The original website][This website]. \r\n\r\nSetup instructions:\r\n\r\n - Put all of your musics planned to import in a directory tree \r\n   whose deepest folders should contain only mp3/ogg files \r\n   and will be automatically transformed as a list.\r\n - `scp` the directory tree in `./music/media`\r\n - run `make` in `./music`\r\n - Voil√†! Go to [the station][station] and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis website is supported for free (both *free as in free speech* and *free as in free beer*) by [yeshiwei][], which is **very** generous of him. [His blog][] is quite interesting.
